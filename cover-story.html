            n Mumbai, typography does not stay on paper. It rushes alongside buses, leans out of rickshaw flaps, clings to thelas, and stretches across the steel of local trains. Every ride is a moving archive of how a city writes its story.

        <h2 class="scroll-slide-left" style="font-family: var(--font-head); font-size: 2.5rem; text-transform: uppercase;">Trucks: Highways of Identity</h2>
        
        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            Long before the city's smaller vehicles take over the inner roads, the highways belong to trucks. These massive, lumbering creatures are perhaps India's most iconic showcases of typography. Their bodies become murals of text. "Horn OK Please" stretches across the back gate in bright hues. Beneath it, you might see "Use Dipper At Night," or the humble "India Is Great."
        </p>

        <img src="https://placehold.co/800x500/ff3c00/fff?text=TRUCK+ART+PHOTO" class="editorial-img scroll-scale scattered">

        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            Each word is not just instruction but culture. Truck typography merges religion, humor, patriotism, longing, and superstition. The fonts are hand-painted, thick, decorative, and accompanied by motifs like lotus flowers or peacocks.

        <blockquote class="scroll-slide-left" style="font-family: var(--font-head); font-size: 2rem; margin: 40px -40px; color: var(--accent); border-left: 5px solid black; padding-left: 20px;">
            "THE TRUCK IS MY HOME FOR MONTHS. WHAT I WRITE ON IT KEEPS ME COMPANY."
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="scroll-slide-left" style="font-family: var(--font-head); font-size: 2.5rem; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 60px;">Rickshaws: Moving Canvases</h2>

        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            If buses are arteries and trains are veins, the rickshaw is the city's beating heart. Their backs are not just painted metal but emotional billboards. Bold strokes in Devanagari, playful flourishes in English, and sometimes Urdu or Gujarati tell stories of faith, family, and humor.
        </p>
        
        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            One driver, Ramesh, had his daughter's name hand-painted across the rear flap. "Every day when I drive, I feel she is with me. It gives me strength." For him, typography is not decoration but devotion.

        <h2 class="scroll-slide-left" style="font-family: var(--font-head); font-size: 2.5rem; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 60px;">Buses & Trains: The Democratic Page</h2>

        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            Where rickshaws speak personally, buses speak collectively. The red bodies of BEST buses carry type that is stripped to essentials. Route numbers appear in stenciled blocks. Yet there is poetry hidden in the repetition. Weathered paint and fading boards form a typography of endurance.
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            Trains provide the narrative. Station names appear on tin script boards, but the chaos of handbills, tuition posters, and Ayurvedic remedy ads creates the true visual landscape. A printed tuition ad might overlap a peeling ad for an herbal tonic. Every compartment becomes a palimpsest of voices.
        </p>

        <h2 class="scroll-slide-left" style="font-family: var(--font-head); font-size: 2.5rem; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 60px;">Thelas: Streetfront Typography</h2>

        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            Away from engines and horns, thelas contribute some of the most playful typography in the city. Painted by hand in bright colors, these wooden carts treat letters as art. A nimbu pani cart may declare "Cool King" in thick blue letters with white shadows. These signs are born from improvisation, not training. They are small explosions of creativity shaped by necessity.
        </p>

        <h2 class="scroll-slide-left" style="font-family: var(--font-head); font-size: 2.5rem; text-transform: uppercase; margin-top: 60px;">Uniforms: Fabric as Type</h2>

        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            The people behind the transport system also carry typography. Auto drivers wear khaki shirts—a color chosen for practicality but now a symbol of identity. Many embroider their names on pockets or add colored scarves. These small additions function like typography on fabric.
        </p>

        <h3 class="scroll-fade-up" style="font-family: var(--font-head);">LANGUAGE ON THE MOVE</h3>
        
        <p class="scroll-fade-up">
            Across trucks, rickshaws, buses, and trains, a pattern emerges. Typography in transit is never neutral. It carries belonging, urgency, identity, and humor. A trucker paints longing on his tailgate. A bus demands clarity in chaos. 
        </p>

        <p class="scroll-fade-up" style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 30px;">
            Mumbai keeps writing itself day after day onto its wheels. Every horn, every slogan, every route number becomes a reminder that here, type is never still. It is always in transit.
